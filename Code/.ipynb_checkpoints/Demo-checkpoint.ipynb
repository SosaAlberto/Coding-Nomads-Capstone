    "### Why are recommender systems important?\n",
    "* In today’s data driven era, understanding users is key to offering a better experience. Whether the application is online shopping, video streaming, or a music platform, a recommender system will improve significantly desired results in terms of user loyalty and sales.“\n",
    "* Current solutions to the problem can be as simple as offering popular items (recommend the latest big blockbuster movie to anyone), to complex systems that analyze user preferences to offer a personalize set of unique items.\n",
    "* In this notebook, 4 different methods to recommend items to a user are analyzed and compared to see the pros and cons of each one.\n",
    "* Our baseline model filters movies by popularity: recommend popular movies to all users no matter how well those movies are rated.\n",
    "* Collaborative filtering: Makes recommendations by analyzing the data to find similarity between users by in terms of their preferences. \n",
    "* Content filtering: recommends movies that are similar to those that the user rates highly. \n",
    "* Results: Given the metrics used to evaluate the different approaches, collaborative filtering performs the best. Popularity filtering has the worst and least personalized results as expected. In addition, we manage to accurately predict user ratings within a range of +/- 0.5 stars.  \n"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for recommender systems is extremely important in today's era where users feed systems with tons of interactions and data. With all that data it is possible to offer a better experience to users in the form of customized content.A good recommender system can improve the user experience thus increasing profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the art imply the use of deep learning systems, there are different approaches such as the use of embeddings to create item or user input vectors.In simple words, embeddings are a way to simplify somethings that needs a high dimensional space into a low dimensional space(we can think space as the number of features), so that way is easy to determine whch items are near to each other(similar).More on embeddings on here: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/motivation-from-collaborative-filtering \n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we approach the problem with traditional ML algorithms, such as pearson correlation coefficient( for collaborative approach) and content filtering in addition to experimenting with the synopsis using basic NLP methods to determine similar synopsis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering consist on finding the best recommendation to our user based on other users, not necessarily on items features. Basically, instead of determining which item is similar to the current content the user consume, lets find users that consume and rate items as similar as our user.Then, once we identify those potentially similar users, we look at the items they have seen and recommend the items on their list that our user has not seen. In this approach we assume that as the users found were similar then we can confidently say our user will like the same content as them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, content filtering consists of different approaches regarding the item features, it can be item-item or user-items recommendations. In this report we focused on the latter. Using the rating of the genres of each movie the user has seen, it is possible to create an input set where the preferences of the user for certain items is reflected..\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, recommendations based on the synopsis to find movies with similar premises. This approach consists of using basic NLP algorithms to analyze the synopsis and, based on the algorithm used, obtain a set of most similar synopses from other movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these algorithms for recommendations, a ML model was implemented to rank those recommendations. The purpose of the model was to predict what rating the user may give to the presented recommended movies, and based on those predicted ratings, rank from highest  to lowest. A random forest regressor was used since other approaches were less effective and had higher errors(MAE).\n",
    "Results are explained later on the report"

    "Now, another feature in the data is timestamp. However it only appears to consist of random numbers, so what is the meaning of such numbers?  If we look at the source where we got the datasets,  we have this description 'Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970'. Then, timestamps represent a date, that may be useful if we want to take into account the year a movie was released. However, at this time we will not take that information into account. We will use purely movie and user content. The reason is because if we take into account that feature we could potentially limit our recommendations to be date dependent (look movies launched the same year) so we choose to avoid any complication this may cause."

    "However, this formula as it is cannot be used since every user may have different standards on how the rate movies,this difference can cause an problem.Therefore, it is necessary to normalize the vectors( in this case only make the distribution have zero mean) by adjusting the formula.Modifying the equation will end up in a special case of Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
